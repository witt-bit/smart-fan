//  ProfileSwitchGate.swift
//  SmartFan
//
//  Orders a profile switch against fan writes the monitor already made for the
//  previous profile. The monitor switches profile on its own queue and each write
//  hops to the main actor, so without this a stale write (a ramp step, or the old
//  profile's max) could land after the reset that ends a profile, and a slow
//  Default could overwrite a profile the user picked after pressing it. The gate
//  reopens when the monitor reports, from its queue, that the switch took effect:
//  writes it made before that arrive first, and the new profile's writes after.
//
