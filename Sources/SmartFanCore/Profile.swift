//  Profile.swift
//  SmartFan
//
//  Fan control profiles with proportional temperature curves.
//
//  Each profile defines a curve that maps temperature to fan speed,
//  along with per-profile ramp rates, sustained triggers, and curve shapes.
//
//  Based on Apple fan hardware research:
//  - 0 to minimum RPM is binary (hardware limitation)
//  - Above minimum, proportional ramping with configurable curve shape
//  - Start/stop cycles are the #1 fan bearing wear factor
//  - At least 5°C hysteresis between start and stop thresholds
//  - Ramp governors are acoustic comfort, not bearing protection
//
