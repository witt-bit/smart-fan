# M4 fan handoff and daemon transport repair

Historical hardware-tested fork build: **0.2.3.2** (`97a8a83`). This is not an upstream release. Later source changes are documented separately in [the maintenance notes](upstream-followups-20260921.md).

The repair was developed against upstream v0.2.3 (`3fbaa527aee05a5a0ed2606f00b50254df9d614f`) and ported onto this fork's `8a344f6` baseline. The intervening commits only changed the idle-CPU investigation document; those changes are preserved. At that commit, core source and regression tests are identical to the locally tested repair.

## Failure

On one M4 Max MacBook Pro, initial fan acquisition from a fully stopped state took longer than the daemon client's two-second timeout. Subsequent state/heartbeat requests also waited behind the hardware lock. The framing layer reported timeout, read failure and EOF as the same `closed` error, making this look like a lost daemon connection.

The connection server's five-second request deadline also included hardware processing and the response write. A valid but slow hardware command could therefore lose its reply. A client disconnect could expose the daemon to SIGPIPE.

Separately, the original per-fan ten-second acquisition limit was insufficient for some cold starts. A first repair build retaining that limit failed after 10.714 seconds even though all 207 concurrent liveness queries succeeded. The final build uses a shared twenty-second acquisition budget; one successful hardware run took over thirteen seconds.

## Changes

| Area | Repair |
| --- | --- |
| Manual acquisition | One monotonic twenty-second budget across the requested fans, rather than ten seconds per fan. |
| Already-manual fans | Read the actual modes on each call and skip unnecessary `Ftst`, mode writes and sleeps. A system handback or wake is not hidden by cached ownership. |
| Client timeout | Thirty seconds for `max`, `set`, `setfan` and `auto`; two seconds retained for queries. These are socket/connect timeouts, not a universal end-to-end latency guarantee under contention. |
| Lock scope | `state`, `heartbeat` and `version` use their existing state synchronization without waiting for the SMC lock. Hardware reads/writes, including `status`, still use that lock. |
| Connection deadlines | Keep the one-second header deadline and separate five-second body/read and response/write deadlines. Do not count synchronous hardware execution against the frame I/O deadline. |
| Broken connections | Set `SO_NOSIGPIPE` on client and accepted sockets; retry interrupted frame I/O; distinguish timeout, EOF and other read errors. |

The connection cap, frame-size cap, command-rate limit and ownership rules remain in place. The profile definitions, temperature monitor and safety invariants are unchanged, including the 95°C safety override. This repair neither changes model/runtime settings nor imposes a new power limit. It does not suppress the high-temperature warning icon.

## Build and automated tests

From this fork's checkout, using a compatible Swift toolchain on macOS:

```sh
swift test --jobs 2
swift build -c release --jobs 2
```

Both commands passed in a fresh checkout of this fork after the repair was transferred. The release CLI reports `0.2.3.2`; this is local verification, not a claim that GitHub Actions ran.

The test suite contains 57 tests, including eight added in `LocalHandoffRepairTests.swift`. The added tests do not access real fan hardware. They cover:

- already-manual and partially manual fast paths;
- simulated twelve-second acquisition and re-reading modes after system handback;
- bounded acquisition failure and per-command timeout/lock policy;
- socket read timeout versus EOF;
- a slow reply surviving the frame deadline while liveness requests complete;
- a disconnected client followed by a successful request.

These tests do not replace hardware acceptance or prove wake behavior on every model.

## Hardware acceptance: 2026-09-21

Reported local hardware: Mac16,5, M4 Max (40-core GPU, 64 GB), macOS 27.0. The final repair was installed before these measurements. Inference was paused; no CPU/GPU stress workload was generated.

Each run started with both fans at 0 RPM under system control, requested maximum speed, queried `version`/`state`/`heartbeat` during acquisition, waited five seconds for physical spin-up, and repeated the same speed command three times. At the end the CLI hold was cleared and the menu bar application reopened with its saved Smart profile.

| Measurement | Run 1 | Run 2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Command completion, including test polling overhead | 8.378 s | 13.022 s |
| Concurrent liveness requests | 162, no errors | 252, no errors |
| Maximum liveness latency | 4.552 ms | 1.909 ms |
| Actual fan speeds after the additional five seconds | 5,792 / 5,803 RPM | 5,836 / 5,808 RPM |
| Requested speed for both fans | 5,777 RPM | 5,777 RPM |
| Subsequent same-speed command latency, including CLI startup | 10.777–11.646 ms | 14.095–18.929 ms |
| Final state | Smart restored; no CLI hold | Smart restored; no CLI hold |

The daemon did not restart during these runs. Application logs contained no new errors during the final-build acceptance window. Preferences and the existing launchd configuration were unchanged. A pre-existing local launchd SIGPIPE-ignore wrapper was retained during hardware acceptance; the socket regression test separately exercises the repair without depending on that wrapper. The wrapper and machine-specific installation/rollback scripts are not part of this repository change.

**Limits:** these are two cold-handoff runs on one machine, not long-duration, reboot or sleep/wake acceptance. Hardware acquisition still takes seconds. The repair does not guarantee a lower sustained GPU temperature, a permanent absence of communication errors, or identical behavior on other Apple Silicon generations.

## Installing this fork

The upstream Homebrew formula does not include this fork's changes. To build/install this fork using the existing installer:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/witt/smart-fan.git
cd smart-fan
./setup.sh
```

Before installing, pause heavy workloads, let the machine cool, and back up the installed application, CLI, daemon configuration and preferences. `setup.sh` replaces the application and daemon, resets fan control, and requires administrator authorization. It can replace a locally customized launchd configuration. It is not necessary to reinstall on the machine already running this tested build merely because the source has been pushed.

After installation, verify the application, CLI and running daemon versions agree, and repeat a cool cold-handoff check before long workloads. If a Homebrew-managed CLI is also present, inspect which binary `command -v thermalforge` selects; the installer does not automatically reconcile every existing Homebrew link. An upstream app update or Homebrew reinstall may overwrite this repair. Keep the prior working installation for rollback; no machine-specific backup or administrator credentials are stored in this repository.
