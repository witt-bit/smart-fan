/// a serial dispatch queue and a pending buffer, so callers run their socket I/O on
/// a background thread by construction — and the coalescing policy can be unit-tested
/// without a daemon. `@unchecked Sendable` because `pending` is guarded by `lock`.

    /// Latest-wins coalescing, but ONLY for consecutive fire-and-forget `.setRPM`
    /// ramp commands (both the tail and the incoming one a plain `.setRPM` with no
    /// completion — a command carrying a completion is never collapsed, so its
    /// result is never lost). During a ramp setRPMs arrive ~10x/sec and each

    /// the newest keeps the fans tracking the CURRENT target instead of replaying a
    /// stale ramp. Off-main already prevents the UI freeze; this bounds queue depth.

    ///   - `.resetAuto` hands control back to macOS; dropping it would strand the
    ///     fans in manual, and letting a later setRPM jump ahead would re-pin fans
    ///     the user asked to release.
    ///   - `.setMax` is a discrete "full blast" hold; collapsing it into an adjacent
    ///     RPM would silently lose the max request.
